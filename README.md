# BV-List-Generator
As a co-music director for PENSA KNUST, one challenge i faced with my co-music director was having to draw a session list for vocalists everytime we had a program. I decided to use my python programming to solve this problem. This program picks vocalists at random and draws the session lists within a minute compared to 30mins of manual work.
